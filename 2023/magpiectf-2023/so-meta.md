## Description

> Hello F-Team,
>
> A member of ours involved in salvaging the many failed Omni-Flags projects has brought us these files. She found it in a half-destroyed computer from one of Omni-Flags deep space probes. They must have been experimenting with flag degredation during deep space flight, but it looks like we should still be able to recover the data.

We are given two PNG strips

The second image looks like the first mixed over with something else, which I'm guessing is the flag, so let's try find the difference
