Spacey CTF hosted by the [Information Security Club](https://infosecucalgary.ca/) from the University of Calgary

The public GitHub repository is here [https://github.com/infosec-ucalgary/magpieCTF-2023](https://github.com/infosec-ucalgary/magpieCTF-2023)

The questions were really interesting and tested a good variety of skills. I really loved the cryptography challenge Momma Says To Play Fair and Rubis, and though I didn't get all the OSINTs, the writeups were fun to read.

I couldn't get a screenshot of my stats, but last I believe I ended with 24th place

**Flags are of the format `magpie{...}`**
