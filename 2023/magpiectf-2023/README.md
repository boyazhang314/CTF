Spacey CTF hosted by the [Information Security Club](https://infosecucalgary.ca/) from the University of Calgary

The public GitHub repository is here [https://github.com/infosec-ucalgary/magpieCTF-2023](https://github.com/infosec-ucalgary/magpieCTF-2023)

The questions were really interesting and tested a good variety of skills. I really loved the cryptography challenge [Momma Says To Play Fair](momma-says-to-play-fair.md) and [Rubis](rubis.md), and though I didn't get all the OSINTs, the writeups were fun to read.

**Flags are of the format `magpie{...}`**
