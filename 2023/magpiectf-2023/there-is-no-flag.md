## There is a flag

The GitHub repository houses a React app. There are also 3 commits, so let's check them out:

The second commit is peculiar, so let's see what was added

Looks like there's a binary program, so let's download it and try it out. Running it just prints "Hello World!", which isn't very interesting. Let's check out more information with `binwalk program`

There's a zip with a Flag.PNG file? We'll have to get that out! Unzip it with `unzip program` and you'll extract Flag.PNG. However we can't open it because the file contains errors

It seems the PNG is corrupted, so let's uncorrupt it

This specific tool will watermark the picture, but you can still read the flag :)
