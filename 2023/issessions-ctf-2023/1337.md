## Let's DCode This

As suggested in the hint, we can use dcode's cipher identifier to figure out the cipher being used

Looks like this ciphertext is highly likely to have been encoded with _Leet Speak 1337_

We try to decrypt and get this bit of information. It's fair to assume that the words being used are "WORLD WIDE WEB"
