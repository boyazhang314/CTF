# Basic Permissions

## Description

> Can you find out how to get permissions to run the file?

## Please let me run you!

At the moment we can't execute the binary. Let's give ourselves execution permissions!

```
chmod +x run_me
```

We can now run the file with `./run_me`

That's a lot of text. Let's CTRL-F for "retroCTF"

## Flag

`retroCTF{u_4r3_4EHU32_gR3p_m45t3R}`
