# Lost Media

## Description

> Oh Snap! I remember listening to this tubular song but I can't remember what its name was. I'm sure the ultimate ISS exec would know but I can't remember who that is either.

## Find the Exec

After digging around and Googling ISSession and Sheridan clubs, we find this website which lists the execs

We find an executive member by the name of "Reginald Boodreau"

With a name, we stalk with social media

Eventually we find a [twitter profile](https://twitter.com/gettingwarm123) with an interesting tweet

## The Sound of Music

It appears we need to find this "lifechanging" "tubular song" by the one and only "Pusha TCP"

After digging Spotify, Youtube, and some other social media apps, an epiphany struck me: There was only one platform for up and coming promising underground musicians

Soundcloud

Lifechanging indeed
{% endembed %}

Absolute. Banger. Straight fire. Slayed. :fire:

Oh yeah, we got the flag in a comment (though it is also spelt out for us in the lyrics of the song)
