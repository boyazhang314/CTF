## Description

> Popular image hosting platform + `5KmhUal` (don't use `/a/`)

## Find the Host

First, we must find this _popular image-hosting platform_, and with a quick Google search we can find this [wonderful list](https://www.wix.com/blog/photography/free-image-hosting-sites)

## Add /a/ Path

Take a look at the rest of the description

> \+ `5KmhUal`

This could imply a few different things, such as an additional search within the website, but most likely this refers to adding to the URL of the website

\-> This is further evidenced by `/a/` which looks like a path

We can go through the list, and potentially try other websites if needed

Fortunately, the search is short and we find what we need with Imgur `https://imgur.com/5KmhUa`
